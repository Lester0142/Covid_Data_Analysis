# US Covid_Data_Analysis #

Dataset are collected from: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home)

# Problem Definition 
#### Using Machine learning models what is the outlook of COVID?
 
# Models used
- [Autoregressive Moving Average](https://github.com/Lester0142/Covid_Data_Analysis/blob/main/ARMA.ipynb)
- [Regression](https://github.com/Lester0142/Covid_Data_Analysis/blob/main/Regression.ipynb)

# Conclusion

The proportion of these new BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 Omicron sub variants are proliferating twice as quickly as the dominant Omicron strain. However, little is known about what impact these mutations might have on the patients in the long run.

Therefore, using our model, we can expect conclude that US have managed covid disease well thus far, but there is no room for complacency as seen in evolving variants. The latest covid variant of BQ is one that is said to be more deadly and spread quicker. If it takes on the characteristics of Omicron which is more resistant to the vaccine. We could potentially see a spike in weekly cases and deaths, despite models predict that the contraction of covid will dwindle in the near future.
